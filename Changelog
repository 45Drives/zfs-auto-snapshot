* Add RBAC support 
  - the service now runs under a zfssnap role
  - service start/stop logs stay under /var/svc/log
  - other logs saved to /export/home/zfssnap (and syslog)
* Add a 'zfs/interval' property value 'none' which doesn't use cron
* Add a 'zfs/fs-name' property value '##'
* Add a cache of svcprops to the method script
* Add a com.sun:auto-snapshot user property, com.sun:auto-snapshot:$LABEL
  takes precedence
* Remove the seconds field of the snapshot name - we don't really need it
* Make recursive snapshots the default for bundled '//' manifests
* Changed the way // works with recursive snapshots
  (look for local props only when using -r)
* Set avoidscrub to false by default (bug was fixed in in nv_94)
* Bugfix from Dan - Volumes are datasets too
* Automatically snapshot everything by setting com.sun:auto-snapshot=true
  on startup. (this gets done on all root pools - existing properties set
  to false will override this)

* Clean up shell style
* Clean up preremove script
* Write this Changelog
