0.12

* Add event-based snapshots
* Add support to change the separator character in snapshot names
  - set the default value of "zfs/sep" to "_"
  - useful for CIFs clients that previously choked on colons in snapshot names
* Improved shutdown speed via http://blogs.sun.com/dp/entry/speeding_to_a_halt
* Add support to allow the user disable auto-snapshots of new pools
* Bugfix to allow snapshots of datasets with spaces in their names
* Bugfix to properly deal with namespace clashes in dataset names
* Exported $LAST_SNAP and $PREV_SNAP variables when performing backups
  - useful to things like the "zfs-backup-to-s3" project on kenai.com

0.11

* Add RBAC support 
  - the service now runs under a zfssnap role
  - service start/stop logs stay under /var/svc/log
  - other log messages sent to syslog
* Add a 'zfs/interval' property value 'none' which doesn't use cron
* Add a cache of svcprops to the method script
* Add a com.sun:auto-snapshot user property used by all instances,
  com.sun:auto-snapshot:$LABEL takes precedence
* Remove the seconds field of the snapshot name - it's not needed
* Changed the way // works with recursive snapshots - ignore
  snapshot-children, and instead automatically determine when we can take
  recursive snapshots based on which datasets have the zfs user properties
* Set avoidscrub to false by default (bug was fixed in in nv_94)
* Bugfix from Dan - Volumes are datasets too
* Automatically snapshot everything by setting com.sun:auto-snapshot=true
  on startup. (this gets done on all top level datasets - an existing 
  property set to false on the top level dataset overrides this)
* Check for missed snapshots on startup
* Clean up shell style
* Clean up preremove script
* Remove the bundled GUI applications
* Tag the method script with the current changeset during the build
* Write this Changelog
